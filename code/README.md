# Code build and run instructions

The final product is present under `Crux v4 exe`. The Unity project that generated it is under the folder `Crux v4`. You would have to download just the contents of this folder and open it in Unity. It will create the Library folder and by switching the scene to `SampleScene` or `Game`, you can see our work. 

This corresponds to prototype A. But if you want to see prototype B (a version that does not have the introduction or hints), you can see that under `CruxB v3`.
